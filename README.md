For Cryotweezer:
Make sure to check the take steps ticker when trying to take x amount of steps and uncheck it when you're trying to move to a specific coordinate

In order for a relatively cube-like shape for a built-in shape for the stage to trace, make sure to calibrate first. There may be times when the zigzag pattern doesn't work perfectly due to hardware issues (I think or maybe the code sucks) so first try out the zigzag shape with one second intervals between each step

Executable file that allows user to view pressure changes over time of TIC

If executable is flagged by antivirus and deleted, make the folder an exception inside of the antivirus. There isn't any malware (trust) To have it working, plug in TIC's USB
